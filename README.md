# form.html
- `index.html`: Contains the complete HTML form implementation.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining the project, form structure, and usage.

## Implementation Notes
- The form uses semantic HTML5 elements such as `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`, and appropriate input types.
- Accessibility is enhanced by associating labels with inputs via `for` and `id` attributes.
- The form includes ARIA attributes where necessary to improve screen reader support.
- The form uses HTML5 validation attributes like `required`, `pattern`, and appropriate input types (`email`, `date`, `tel`).

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Fill out the form fields and submit
